Historical Value at Risk (VaR) Simulation
1. Download Data
2. Compute Daily Returns: Calculates the percentage change between each day’s closing price.
3. Visualize Return Distribution: Plots histograms of the daily returns scaled to a 30-day window to show how volatile each asset is.
4. Calculate 1-Day Historical VaR: Finds the 5th percentile of historical returns (1 - 95% confidence), which represents the worst expected daily loss with 95% confidence.
5. Scale to 30-Day VaR: Multiplies the 1-day VaR by the square root of 30 (√30), assuming returns are independent and identically distributed (IID).
6. Display Results: Prints out the estimated 30-day VaR for each asset.

30-Day Value at Risk (95% Confidence):
BTC-USD: 0.1725
TSLA:    0.1980

This means:
With 95% confidence, 
- Bitcoin is not expected to lose more than 17.25% of its value over the next 30 days.
- Tesla is not expected to lose more than 19.80% over the same period.
