Summary of the Output(Kelly Criterion):

"The log of terminal financial wealth is 2.0302" means that after running the simulation:
- The average log of final wealth is 2.0302.
- When converted back to actual wealth: ùëí2.0302 ‚âà 7.88

So, on average, the final wealth becomes 7.88 times the initial capital (e.g., $1 grows to $7.88) after 100 bets using the Kelly strategy (betting 20% of the capital each time).

Key Points:
- The simulation uses Kelly Criterion, which optimizes bet sizing to maximize long-term exponential growth while minimizing the risk of ruin.
- The result shows that using this method with a 60% win rate and 1:1 payout ratio, your capital can grow significantly over time.
- The use of logarithmic wealth (log(wealth)) reflects compound growth, which is more realistic for measuring wealth accumulation in trading and investing.
